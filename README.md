### INSTALLATION

All you have to do is download and extract the zip (from above), then follow the below steps to add the library to your project.

Extract the zip and copy the folder **EH-1.0** to your project's **libs** directory (`.../YourProject/app/libs`), then add the library as a dependency in your application/module `build.gradle` file (`.../YourProject/app/build.gradle`).

```groovy
dependencies {
  api project(':app:libs:EH-1.0:eh')
}
```

### USAGE

Initialize **EH** in your **Application** with a new **EH.Builder** instance, passing to it the application **Context**...

```java
// import the class

import com.cyberking.developer.eh.EH;

public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate () {

        // Create new Builder instance passing to it the application context

        new EH.Builder (this)
            .init (); // Initialize EH

        super.onCreate ();
    }
}
```

or in **Activity** as...

```java
// import the class

import com.cyberking.developer.eh.EH;

public class MyActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    public void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState) {

        // Create new Builder instance passing to it the application context

        new EH.Builder (getApplicationContext ())
            .init (); // Initialize EH

        super.onCreate (savedInstanceState);
    }
}
```

### CONSTRUCTOR

```java
public EH.Builder (Context appContext)
```

### METHODS

Use these methods to set configurations for **EH** before call to `init ()`.

```java
public EH.Builder enable (boolean enable)
```
> Default Value : true

Enable/disable **EH**. If disabled, exceptions are forwarded to the **Default Uncaught Exception Handler** that was present before call to `init ()`.


```java
public EH.Builder runInBackground (boolean runInBackground)
```
> Default Value : true

Whether **EH** should run when app is stopped i.e after call to `onStop ()`.


```java
public EH.Builder addSuppressed (boolean add)
```
> Default Value : true

Whether to include suppressed exceptions in the crash log.


```java
public EH.Builder setMaxActivityLogs (int max)
```
> Default Value : 100

Set the maximum number of activity lifecycle logs/traces to include in the crash log. The last **max** logs are included in the log.


```java
public EH.Builder setMaxStackTraceSize (int size)
```
> Default Value : 100

Set the maximum number of stack traces to include in the crash log. The first **size** stack traces are included in the log.


```java
public EH.Builder addEmailAddresses (String... emailAddresses)
```
> Default Value : none

Add email addresses included in the **Intent** used to forward/send crash log to developers.


```java
public void init ()
```
Initialize/set up **EH** with the configurations above.

**Tip :** You can change the configurations for **EH** after call to `init ()` by creating a new **EH.Builder** instance or use the old one, then initializing it with the new configurations and making another call to `init ()`.


### EXAMPLE

```java
// import the class

import com.cyberking.developer.eh.EH;

public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override public void onCreate() {
    
    // Create new Builder passing application context, then setting configurations and initializing EH
    
    new EH.Builder (this)
        .enable (true)
        .runInBackground (true)
        .setMaxActivityLogs (50)
        .setMaxStackTraceSize (50)
        .addEmailAddresses ("email0@gmail.com", "email1@gmail.com", "email2@gmail.com")
        .init ();
    }
}
```

**NOTE : DO NOT FORGET TO MAKE A CALL TO THE METHOD `init ()` OR *EH* WILL NOT RUN AND YOUR APPLICATIONS WILL CRASH NORMALLY.**
